[Yeah
G-Unit Nigga
50 Cent
You Heard Me
Irv I don't believe you let that nigga talk
You fat cupcake eatin' mothafucka
I'll fuck you up nigga
Fuckin' punk ass nigga
Don't nobody respect you nigga
You Preme's son nigga
Mothafucka's been gettin' extorted since day one
Its all kinda bitch in ya, chinese, spanish, black, white

I got X
Method slabs and cocaine
So the feds wanna search us
Like arabs boardin' tha planes
I'm in tha range
Switchin' lanes
Reminscin' on cans and sardines

And car dreams
I'm burnin' unfamiliar bud
Got a shotgun like Elmer Fudd
That'll let off and leave you hella blood
Ma I'm hip to tha game
Blue ice chips in the chain
A few nights skipped on the plane
With two white chicks gettin' brain
Bang bang from big heaters
Hundred dollar sneakers
Two seaters
Two ninas

And a bundle of hayes
At least enough to last fourteen days
He wouldn't sell lobster
My eyes slanted like Pharell's partner
Nigga respect like your father when it comes to drama
I put tha llama to your mama
And beat her like a pinata

Nigga I been hotta since '97
You been beggin' tha 5th kick like a kung-fu legend
One blue seven
Whats poppin' nigga?
Different day same shit
What you coppin' nigga?
S-K's want bricks, shit
You wind up dead with this
So why turn soft?
Straight bullets will burn a niggas sideburns off
I gotta model with a sick ass
Bagged her off 5th ave.
Fucked her offa hot dog and a playoff knick pass

Now we shoppin in tha malls on tha westcoast
And as far as pussy
I been through more walls than asbestos
So lets toast
And have a sex on tha beach
These niggas quotin' my lines like a Martin Luther King speech
Remember Patrice
She looked like Kelis
Met her in club
And caught her eyein' my piece
And with all the birds at tha show
I had to fuck tha crazy hoe
Callin' Hot 97 'cause she knows I'm on tha radio
(Ha Ha Bitch)

[50 Talking]
Yea
Ja you little Stuart Little lookin' mothafucka
Catch you I'll break your mothafuckin' neck nigga
You only weigh 110 pounds you little fagot
I know tha stylist you been fuckin' too nigga
I paid him 50, 000
Check my album out nigga
February 11th you gonna hear him talk
You little bitch
Tryin' to jump off like its a promotional stunt
Seven days before your album drop
Huh.you little bitch

Order of protection
From who?
Who I need an order of protection from nigga? (Laughs)
Ya lil' k.awe man
Mothafuckas man
Ya'll niggas is gonna make this a lot of fun for me
