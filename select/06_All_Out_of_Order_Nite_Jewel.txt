I'm not surprised that no one's home
I'm not surprised I'm all alone
Because there's often vacancy
In my mind

Turn it all on and off
But that doesn't seem enough
Turn it all on and off
But that doesn't seem that much

All out of order

Turn it all on and off
But that doesn't seem enough
Turn it all on and off
But that doesn't seem that much

All out of order

You think I'm queer
I often do
Who does it matter to
Because there's often vacancy
In my mind
Turn it all on and off
But that doesn't seem that much

All out of order
