Order of the day to come
Thus the end, the ends
Darkest hour, obsidian
Cast of stone, the Night
With a slight of who not harmed
Hit or touched
What will be, the end
How come the rising sun matches still
In to gold, it holds
Comes the dawn, golden dawn
Darkness turn to day
Order of Golden Dawn
(Eastern rising sun)
Boxers without it all
(Fists of righteousness)
Order of Golden Dawn
(Eastern rising sun)
Boxers without it all
(Fists of righteousness)
Order of Golden Dawn
(Eastern rising sun)
Boxers without it all
(Fists of righteousness)
Heat the warming bloody red
Morning sky
Soldiers now, beware
Drink the tea, liquid shield
Brewed and fed so well
Evening serves, water gals
All that's left, intact
Soldiers tasting dragon's tea, summer ring
Rise again, begin
Order of Golden Dawn
(Eastern rising sun)
Boxers without it all
(Fists of righteousness)
Order of Golden Dawn
(Eastern rising sun)
Boxers without it all
(Fists of righteousness)
Order of Golden Dawn
(Eastern rising sun)
Boxers without it all
(Fists of righteousness)
